Setup and Installation (if any): 
Run the program with the location of the file you want to scan as the first argument, look at Sample Invocation to see how it is formatted.

TO RUN THE PROGRAM, run Parser.java (where main is) and have it consume the pathname of the program file as an argument.  This argument can be added and ran via Run Configurations.  A sample format of a pathname may be "./data/sample-5.acod."  Sample program files are located in the data package.

Features added: None
